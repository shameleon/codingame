 Goal
You have just inherited of a small plot of land of width W and height H with some trees on it. You want to grow a forest, but you have only 1 seed to plant. Find the maximum number of trees after 33 years you can have by planting the seed at the best place.

Rules:
-Seeds need 10 years to grow into a tree.
-Trees produce 4 seeds around them after one year.
-Trees may already be present on your land. They will also produce seeds after one year.

Year 0 : X is your one and only seed and Y is a tree already present.

Maybe if you plant the seed at another place you can get a bigger forest in the end.
When you will find the best place, you will need to give the number of trees you get after 33 years.
Input
Line 1 : an integer W for the width of the parcel.
Line 2 : an integer H for the height of the parcel.
Next H lines : each line of the land, with trees (Y) or grass (.).
Output
Line 1 : an integer N for the number of trees you can have on your land after 33 years by planting your seed at the best place.
Constraints
1 <= W <= 40
1 <= H <= 40
